##Problem 1.
##Write a program that computes and prints the 1000th prime number.

p = 1
i = 1
a = 3
# first prime is two (i=1) so start testing at p = 3


while (i<1000) :

    p = p + 2       # test new p   
    a = 3           # reset a

    while (a<(p/2)) :
        
        if (p%a == 0) :     # if TRUE -> NOT PRIME 
            p = p + 2   # test new p
            a = 3       # reset a
            
        else : a = a+2       # if FALSE increase a to next odd num
        
    # a reaches p -> p == prime
    i = i+1

print p
