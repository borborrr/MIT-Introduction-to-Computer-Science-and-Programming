##Problem 2.
##Write a program that computes the sum of the logarithms of all the primes from 2 to some
##number n, and print out the sum of the logs of the primes, the number n, and the ratio of these
##two quantities. Test this for different values of n. 

import math

p = 1
i = 1
a = 3
# first prime is two (i=1) so start testing at p = 3

n = 1000
logSum = math.log(2)

while (i<n) :

    p = p + 2       # test new p   
    a = 3           # reset a

    while (a<(p/a)) :    #only need to check half of the values
        
        if (p%a == 0) :     # if TRUE -> NOT PRIME 
            p = p + 2   # test new p
            a = 3       # reset a
            
        else : a = a+2       # if FALSE increase a to next odd num
        
    # a reaches p -> p == prime
    i = i+1

    logSum = logSum + math.log(p)   #Add log(p) to sum of logs
    
    
print 'logSum = ',logSum, n,'th prime = ', p , 'Ratio = ', logSum/p
